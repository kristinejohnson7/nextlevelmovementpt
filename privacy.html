          Operations: Providers use and disclose PHI in connection with their
          standard business operations, including quality assessment and

          and general administrative activities, including data and information
          systems management, customer service, resolution of internal
          grievances, and sales, mergers, transfers, or consolidations with
          other providers or health plans or prospective providers or health
          plans. Use and Disclosure Without Acknowledgement or Authorization
          There are certain circumstances under which we may use or disclose
          your medical information without first obtaining your Acknowledgement
          or Authorization. Those circumstances generally involve public health
          and oversight activities, law enforcement activities, judicial and
          administrative proceedings and in the event of death. Specifically, we
          are required to report to certain agencies information concerning
          certain communicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and
          HIV/AIDS status. We are also required to report instances of suspected
          or documented abuse, neglect or domestic violence. We are required to
          report to appropriate agencies and law enforcement officials
          information that you or another person are in immediate threat of
          danger to your health or safety as a result of violent activity. We
          must also provide medical record information when ordered by a court
          of law to do so. Authorization for Use or Disclosure Except as
          outlined in the above sections, your medical information will not be
          used or disclosed to any other person or entity without your specific
          Authorization, which may be revoked at any time. In particular, except
          to the extent disclosure has been made to governmental entities
          required by law to maintain the confidentiality of the information,
          information will not be further disclosed to any other person or
          entity with respect to information concerning mental health treatment,
          drug and alcohol abuse, HIV/AIDS, or sexually transmitted diseases
          which may be contained in your medical records. We likewise will not
          disclose your medical record information to an employer for purposes
          of making employment decisions, to a liability insurer or attorney as
          a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, or to
          educational authorities, without your written authorization.
          Additional Uses and Disclosures Appointment Reminders and Treatment
          Alternatives: We may contact you to provide appointment reminders or
          information about treatment alternatives or other health-related
          benefits or services that may be of interest by phone and answering
          machine, at phone numbers that you provide us, or by mail. Marketing:
          We must obtain your written authorization prior to using your PHI to
          send you any marketing materials. (We can however, provide you with
          marketing material in a face-to-face encounter, without obtaining Your
          Marketing Authorization. We are also permitted to give you a
          promotional gift of nominal value, if we so choose, without obtaining
          Your Marketing Authorization.) Workers Compensation: We may disclose
          health information to the extent authorized by and to the extent
          necessary to comply with laws relating to workers compensation or
          other similar programs established by law. Public Health and Safety:
          We may use or disclose PHI as necessary to prevent or reduce a serious
          and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public,
          to people who may be able to reduce the threat, including the
          threatened person or law enforcement officials; or for other public
          health activities to public health authorities (such as the
          Pennsylvania Department of Health or the U.S. Department of Health and
          Human Services) engaged in preventing or controlling disease, injury,
          or disability. For example, New York health care providers are
          required to report information about patients with certain conditions,
          such as HIV/AIDS and cancer, to central registries; they also are
          required to report information about immunizations administered to
          their patients. We also may disclose PHI to manufacturers of drugs,
          biologics, devices, and other products regulated by the federal Food
          and Drug Administration when the information is related to their
          quality, safety, or effectiveness. PHI also may be disclosed to
          certain people exposed to communicable diseases and to employers in
          connection with occupational health and safety or worker’s
          compensation matters. Required by Law: We may use or disclose PHI to
          the extent such use or disclosure is required by law and it complies
          with and is limited to the requirements of that law. For example, if
          you are treated by one of our Providers for a gunshot or knife wound
          or similar trauma, we may be required to report that information to
          the police. If we suspect a person is a victim of abuse, neglect, or
          domestic violence, we may be required to file a report to the
          authorities or another local or state agency and possibly to the
          police as well. We also use and disclose PHI for certain law
          enforcement purposes and in response to official subpoenas, court
          orders, discovery requests and other legal process.In addition, we use
          and disclose PHI in connection with health oversight activities (e.g.,
          government audits of our compliance with certain laws and regulations;
          oversight of government-funded health benefits programs, etc.). Other
          Government Functions: We may use or disclose PHI in connection with
          military and veterans activities, national security and intelligence
          activities, protective services for the President of the United States
          and other dignitaries, and certain correctional facility activities.
          Family and Friends: Under certain circumstances, we may disclose PHI
          to family members, other relatives, or close personal friends or
          others that you identify to the extent it is directly relevant to
          their involvement with your care or payment related to your care; or
          to notify them of your location, general condition, or death. After
          Death: We may disclose PHI to coroners or medical examiners to
          identify a person who has died, determine the cause of death, or
          perform other functions authorized by law; and (before or after death)
          to funeral homes as necessary to carry out their duties. In addition,
          PHI of a person who has died may be used or disclosed in connection
          with research that does not involve any live subjects. Individual
